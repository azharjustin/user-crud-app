Installation and Running the App

1. git clone https://github.com/azharjustin/user-crud-app.git
2. cd user-crud-app
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

Details:
1. first I created a fresh React app
2. Install the Axios for the fetching and perform the API operations
3. use the jsonplaceholder for getting the user data
4. Install the Material UI for the components(button,data table, dialog,side drawer, input fields)
5. Show the user's data in the table format with pagination
6. add the drawer for creating the new user
7. use the jsonplaceholder post API to create the new user
8. Install the react notify to notify the success and error responses
9. implement the edit and update function
10. update the existing user by jsonplaceholder put api
11. implement the delete operation and use the Dialog component to ask the conformation to delete the user
12. delete the user by using jsonplaceholder delete API
13. this whole flow is done in the same app.jsx file.
14. after that I make the component wise.
15. I create a new file for each component 
16. finally, I used all the components in the app.jsx file
17. after completing the component-wise, again check all the functionalities 
18. for reference I have given my whole single-page development in the SingleFile.jsx file

If you give me more time I can make this a full-stack project, I can implement my API with a database
